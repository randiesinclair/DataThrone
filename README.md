With this database I researched the top 3 deadliest areas of this world, the top 5 killers in each of those areas, and also the top 5 deaths by allegiance in each of the 3 areas. To clarify, I wanted to know what allegiance it was most dangerous for in each of those areas. If you’ve never seen this show and plan to, turn your volume all the way down right now. Many spoilers ahead!

You may be wondering as I did, who in their right mind took the time to count every single one of the alleged 6,887 deaths over the course of 8 seasons of this show… This insane and wonderful individual is Shelly Tan, a graphics reporter specializing in data visualization, illustrations and pop culture. I wanted to be sure to thank and properly credit her for her efforts.

With a dataset like this, there are so many variables, that a methodology must be established to be able to research and get the results that we seek. Some of the decisions that were made to create this dataset include:
A death is only counted if the character is killed on-screen. UNLESS, the character dies off-screen but the death is confirmed or assumed due to imminent death while on screen. The exception would be prominent off-screen deaths, and prominence is determined mostly by importance to the plot.

Another decision that was made for this dataset was that if a character orders the death of another, the character who does the direct killing receives credit; not the one who orders the kill. But for cases where the direct killer is unidentifiable, like when Cersei Lannister uses the caches of wildfire to blow up the Great Sept of Baelor, the order giver receives the credit.

It is also noted that for big battles such as the Battle of the Bastards, it is often unclear which side a soldier being killed belongs to. Educated guesses were made based on the details like the shape of a helmet a soldier is wearing, along with other things like sigils that can be seen on armor.
